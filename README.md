A DotA 2 focused bot, allowing you to quickly view specific patch notes for a hero or item. Also supports showing info about heroes, abilities, and items.

Also has a news feed too!

More features coming in The Future‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

The Future‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
My immediate plans once I have the time are as follows: (NOTE these are subject to change and are not a promise, but what I do intend to do currently.)
- DPC/TI related features: I want to add schedule, current bracket, general stats, etc.
- Additional game information
- Steam/stats linking: I want to link with OpenDota etc. and allow users to quickly share their latest game, stats etc. 
- Localisation: Making all commands and responses localised at much as possible, thankfully all the game data has its own localisations, but any content I write does not. This will require changing how this is implemented in code, before I can provide localisation templates.

I have other plans and ideas for the future, but I'll be focusing on the biggest features I feel there are little or no availability currently from other bots and services

`Magus.DataBuilder` will need a massive optimisation at some point to run quicker, such as by handling only updated values, and so that it can be automated to keep minor changes and localisation patches that are pushed out on a frequent basis.

Extracting data directly from the game wouldn't be possible without [Valve Resource Format](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/ValveResourceFormat) from SteamDB. Many thanks to xPaw and all the other contributers to this project üíö

While the bot is open source, please be aware I am offering no support to help you run your own instance if you so prefer, sorry but I don't have the time üòÖ
